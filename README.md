## Introduction

This project focuses on building a different classification model to predict the data which is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking organization. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. It also invloves finding the best model that helps in the prediction  of the bank term deposit.
## Business Problem

The Portuguese banking organization has conducted a bank marketing campaign to all the customers through phone calls to place a term deposit. Now the organization needs help to predict if a customer would place a term deposit(yes) or not(no) after all the marketing effort taken.

## The Data

It is a dataset that describing Portugal bank marketing campaigns results. Conducted campaigns were based mostly on direct phone calls, offering bank client to place a term deposit.
If after all marking afforts client had agreed to place deposit - target variable marked 'yes', otherwise 'no'. 

The source of the data can be found in the following link (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

## Approach

In this project we are following OSEMN data science workflow. It contains:
* Obtain (Generate data)
* Scrub (extracting columns,handling missing values)
* Explore (understanding data and create visualization)
* Model (building regression model)
* Interpret (communicating results)

## Analysis

Data analysis is made on the different variables of the dataset and 4 different models are built for prediction.
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* XG Boost
* KNN Algorithm

The entire code  and feauture engineering model work can be found as follows:
